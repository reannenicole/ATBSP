This repository is a personal learning space for the book "Automate the Boring Stuff" by Al Sweigart. 
Documented within is a summary of all lessons and challenges undetaken from working through it. 

This repository does not cover the installation and setup part of the book. 
It is also not intended to be a replacement for the book, and is set up exclusively to document and demonstrate my learning experience. 

All credit and thanks to Al.
